The idea of this assignment is to create a website using a framework.  
In this assignment I want to use as little CSS as possible. 
However, I may want to change some things. 
For example, colors and fonts, but when it comes to many other things, such as layouts, margins and sizes of texts, 
I would like to avoid changing them. 
Sometimes you just have to accept how the manufacturer of the framework has chosen to do certain things. 
That said, it is not illegal to write my own CSS, but I try to do it in as few places as possible. 
The idea of using a framework is to get to a final product in less time.
